  # These histograms symmetric and zero-centered (the centermost bin is the
  # probability of zero). Histograms are normalized to sum to 1.0 and they have
  # 2^N-1 bins for some integer N. Higher N yields higher-fidelity histograms,
  # but also increases runtime & the size of YAML files. Encoding functions will
  # upsample or downsample histograms depending on the bitwidth of the
  # corresponding operands.
